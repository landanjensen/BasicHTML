    <h1>Ancient Greece</h1><br>
    <p>Ancient Greece was a very beautiful but messed up place. Greece was founded in the stone age.<br>
     small farming villages began growing, building walls and collecting taxes for protection.<br>
    Greece highly believed in not letting "ordinary people" rule, they were very involved in <br>
    polotics and were very problematic. Greece ended up having problems within their own country <br>
    causing Rome to notice and attack. Greece eventually fell and was conquered by the Romans. <br>
    It had a population of 20,000,000 at the time and spoke many different languages. Ancient Greece <br>
     was a pluricentric language, divided into many dialects. The main dialect groups are Attic and <br>
     Ionic, Aeolic, Arcadocypriot, and Doric, many of them with several subdivisions.
